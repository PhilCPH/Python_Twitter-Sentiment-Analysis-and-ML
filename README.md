### Philipp, Merle, Kevin

In this project we have chosen to predict stock development based on a Twitter sentiment analysis which is sourced by COVID-19 related keywords and relate it to COVID-19 infections and deaths over the same timeframe.

Our problem statement was:

Can COVID-19 related sentiments, measured via Twitter, in combination with actual case and death counts predict current and future stock market development in the US?

In this project weâ€™re working with three datasets: COVID-19 cases in the US, a Twitter dataset based on COVID-19 related keywords and S&P 500 data.
